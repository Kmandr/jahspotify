Jah'Spotify Project
===============================================================================

---- Introduction -----

Jah'Spotify is a simple Java wrapper built on top of the libspotify APIs.

Currently supports:

- retrieving library (all user playlists)
- retrieve a playlist
- retrieve an album
- retrieve a track
- retrieve an image
- add tracks to a queue
- play tracks
- pause/skip/play functions

All the above functions are accessible over a RESTful API.  This is very much work in progress and will most likely
change over time.

NOTE: As with libspotify

---- To build -----

Currently, Jah'Spotify only supports the Linux version of libspotify and will therefore require a Linux installation
to compile.  You also need to download and install libspotify.

To build the sources, check 'em out from git

git clone git://github.com/johanlindquist/jahspotify.git
cd jahspotify
mvn clean install

---- Modules -----

- api: provides the basic operations for interacting with Jah'Spotify (and in turn libspotify)
- native: contains all native & JNI code interacting with libspotify
- web: provides the RESTful API

---- REST API -----

To run up the Jah'Spotify RESTful API
